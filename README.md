# Image_Classification


Image classification is a computer vision task that involves sorting images into predefined classes or categories based on their visual content. The purpose of image classification is to teach computer algorithms to recognize and assign text to images. category tag. During training, the algorithm learns to extract relevant features from input images and assign them to corresponding lists. These methods often involve machine learning and deep learning. This model analyzes the visual properties of the input image and the output class or classes to which it belongs, as well as a confidence score for each prediction. Facial recognition, medical image analysis, driverless cars, content-based image capture and more. Being able to make decisions and understand many images is an important task in computer vision.

The dataset that we have used is CIFAR10 dataset 

DESCRIPTION ON CIFAR10 DATASET
The CIFAR-10 dataset is a widely used dataset in computer science and machine learning. There are 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different categories, 6,000 images in each category. The dataset is divided into training and testing sets, consisting of 50,000 images for training and 10,000 images for testing.

The 10 classes in the CIFAR-10 dataset are as follows:

1.Airplane
2.Automobile
3.Bird
4.Cat
5.Deer
6.Dog
7.Frog
8.Horse
9.Ship
10.Truck

FOR THE PROJECT WE HAVE USED CNN FOR OUR IMAGE CLASSIFICATION 

CNN stands for Convolutional Neural Network, which is a type of deep neural network designed to process objects such as images. CNN has revolutionized the field of computer vision and is widely used in tasks such as image classification, object detection and segmentation.

Key components of CNNs include:



1.Convolutional Layers: These layers apply convolution operations to input images using learnable filters or kernels. Convolutional operations help the network learn features such as edges, textures, and patterns from the input images.

2.Pooling Layers: Pooling layers downsample the feature maps obtained from the convolutional layers, reducing their spatial dimensions. Common pooling operations include max pooling and average pooling, which help to extract the most salient features while reducing computation.

3.Activation Functions: Non-linear activation functions like ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) are applied after convolutional and pooling operations to introduce non-linearity into the network, allowing it to learn complex relationships in the data.

4.Fully Connected Layers: After several convolutional and pooling layers, the high-level features learned by the network are flattened and passed to one or more fully connected layers. These layers perform classification or regression tasks based on the learned features.

5.Regularization Techniques: CNNs often use regularization techniques such as dropout and batch normalization to prevent overfitting and improve generalization performance.

CNNs use the spatial hierarchy of features present in an image; here the lower layers detect simple features such as edges and corners, while the upper layers capture features that are more obscure and impact the task at hand. CNN has demonstrated excellent performance in many computer vision tasks and has become a foundational technology in areas such as image recognition, object detection, image analysis and editing, pain and driving disorders.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION


Image classification using the CIFAR-10 dataset involves training a model to correctly classify images into one of ten categories: airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, and truck. The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images, with 6,000 images per class.

A brief overview of the steps involved in image classification using the CIFAR-10 dataset:

1.Data Preparation: Load the CIFAR-10 dataset and preprocess the images. Preprocessing steps may include resizing, normalization, and data augmentation to improve model generalization.

2.Model Selection: Choose a suitable deep learning model architecture for image classification. Common choices include Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) due to their effectiveness in handling image data.

3.Model Training: Train the selected model on the CIFAR-10 training set. During training, the model learns to map input images to their corresponding class labels by adjusting its parameters using techniques like gradient descent and backpropagation.

4.Model Evaluation: Evaluate the trained model's performance on a separate validation set or through cross-validation. Common evaluation metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

5.Model Fine-Tuning (Optional): Fine-tune the model by adjusting hyperparameters, changing the model architecture, or incorporating regularization techniques to improve performance further.

6.Model Testing: Test the final trained model on the CIFAR-10 test set to assess its real-world performance. This step helps to validate the model's generalization ability on unseen data.

7.Deployment (Optional): Deploy the trained model for inference on new images, either locally or in a production environment, to make predictions on unseen data.
